## 🧠 Summary
I have over 11 years of software development experience, working with companies ranging from small 10-person teams to large corporations with over 350,000 employees, in both front-end and full-stack developer roles. Successfully launched projects from scratch, maintained large-scale applications, and facilitated the transition from MVPs to long-term, maintainable products. I’m self-motivated and can work independently, as evidenced by my remote work experience over the last 8 years.
